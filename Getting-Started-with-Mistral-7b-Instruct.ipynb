Tokyo, Japan: A bustling metropolis full of flashing lights, towering skyscrapers, and a unique blend of ancient traditions with futuristic technology. It's the perfect combination of the old and new, and you can immerse yourself in a world of shopping, dining, and entertainment that never sleeps. Don't forget to visit famous landmarks like the Tokyo Tower and the iconic Shibuya Crossing.\n2. Paris, France: The City of Light is a classic destination that should be on every traveler's list. Paris boasts stunning architecture, world-renowned museums, and an unparalleled artistic heritage. From the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre Museum, there's no shortage of iconic sights to see and explore. And if you're lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of the Mona Lisa smile.\n3. Sydney, Australia: If you're looking for breathtaking natural beauty coupled with a vibrant city life, Sydney is the place to be. With its stunning coastline, lush parks, and beaches that stretch as far as the eye can see, Sydney offers plenty of opportunities to relax and soak up the sun. But don't forget to explore the city itself, with its Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and diverse neighborhoods that each have their own unique charm.\n\nRemember to find a balance between work and play, even when traveling.

Give me two options, along with the whole recipe for each [/INST] Sure, I would be happy to help! Here are two vegetarian dishes that I think will impress your friend:\n1. Roasted Butternut Squash Risotto with Parmesan Cheese\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 large butternut squash, peeled and cubed\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* Salt and pepper\n* 1 cup Arborio rice\n* 4 cups vegetable broth\n* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* Fresh parsley, chopped\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Toss the cubed butternut squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the squash on a baking sheet and roast it in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and slightly browned.\n\nIn a large saucepan, heat the vegetable broth over medium heat. In a separate large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Add the Arborio rice and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes, until the rice is lightly toasted and the oils are absorbed.\n\nGradually add the hot vegetable broth, stirring constantly, and add more broth as needed until the rice is tender. Once the rice is tender, remove it from the heat and stir in the roasted butternut squash and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve the risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley.\n2. Vegetable Stir-Fry with Tofu and Sesame Seeds\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n* 1 package of firm tofu, drained and cubed\n* 2 cups sliced mushrooms\n* 1 red bell pepper, sliced\n* 1 green bell pepper, sliced\n* 1 onion, sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 inch piece of ginger, grated\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp honey\n* 1 tbsp cornstarch\n* 1/2 cup vegetable broth\n* 1/4 cup chopped scallions\n* 2 tbsp sesame seeds\n\nInstructions:\n\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the tofu, mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir constantly and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender.\n\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, cornstarch, and vegetable broth to make a sauce. Pour the sauce over the vegetables and stir constantly until the sauce thickens.\n\nAdd the chopped scallions and sesame seeds to the pan and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes, until the scallions are wilted and the sesame seeds are lightly toasted. Serve the stir-fry hot, over rice or noodles.\n\nI hope these recipes help you impress your friend!
